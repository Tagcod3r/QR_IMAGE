## Abstract:
An expense tracker is a vital tool for managing personal or organizational finances efficiently. It helps users monitor their spending, categorize expenses, and track financial goals. Expense trackers enable users to record, view, and analyze their financial data, providing insights into spending patterns and ensuring better budgeting and financial planning.

The Expense Tracker System is designed to simplify the management of daily expenses through an intuitive and user-friendly interface. The system supports functionalities such as recording expenses, categorizing them (e.g., food, travel, utilities), generating reports, and providing real-time financial summaries. It aims to enhance financial awareness and organization for individuals and businesses.

This project employs HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for creating an interactive front-end, ensuring a seamless user experience. The backend is powered by Node.js and Express.js, providing robust server-side logic and handling requests efficiently. Data is stored in a MySQL database, ensuring secure and efficient management of user and expense data. The system facilitates key operations like expense recording, categorization, and report generation.

Key features include role-based access for Admin and Users. Admins can oversee user activity, manage categories, and generate detailed reports. Users can input their daily expenses, view their financial history, and generate personalized financial insights. The system ensures secure data management and real-time updates for an optimal experience.
